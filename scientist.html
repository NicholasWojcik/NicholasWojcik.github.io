								<p>
									Robert Oppenheimer started his educational adventure early in life.  At the age of 12 he was <br>
									invited to give lecture at the New York Mineralogical Club.  When the time came for college to <br>
									to enter his life, he began at Harvard.  Oppenheimer gained a degree in chemistry from Harvard <br>
									and moved on to study physics for his graduate in Germany.  Upon completetion of his doctorates <br>
									he moved back to the United States in 1927 where he would work until being invited into the <br>
									Manhattan Project.

								<p>
									Leo Szilard was a Hungarian physicist.  He helped Albert Einstein draft the famous letter to <br>
									Franklin D. Roosevelt that ignited the Manhattan Project.  As the National Socialist German Workers' <br>
									Party began to grow in Germany, it brought worry to Szilard and prompted him to leave Europe.  The <br>
									National Socialist German Workers' Party would later become the Nazi Party.  Szilard joined the Manhattan <br>
									Project and partnered with Enrico Fermi to create the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.

								<p>
									Hans Bethe was another theoretical physicist that left Germany due to the rise of the Third Reich.  Some <br>
									of his monumental contributions to the advancement of nuclear technology includind the recognition that <br>
									massive stars create their energy and heat through nuclear fusion.  Hans also contributed deeply to the <br>
									formulas used in calculating the critical mass of uranium-235 and the explosive yield of an atomic bomb.

								<p>
									Ernest Lawrence received his doctorate from the University of Claifornia, Berkeley in 1928.  He founded <br>
									academic research laboratories that strengthened his knowledge and understanding of nuclear physics.  In 1929 <br>
									Ernest invented the cyclotron.  Once he was brought onboard the Manhattan Project the cyclotron would aid in <br>
									producing the acceleration of nuclear particles to a high enough speed for atomic disintegration.  His role within <br>
									the Manhattan Project was Program Chief.  Allowing him control over the research of electromagnetic separation of atoms.

								<h2>Klaus Fuchs</h2>
								<h3><span class="green">Theoretical Physicist</span></h3>
								<h3><span class="green">Germany</span></h3>
							</div>
							<div class="right_block">
								<p>
									Klaus Fuchs' journey was abnormal compared to other scientists within the Manhattan Project.  Born in 1911 in Germany, <br>
									he had admiration for communism.  He studied mathematics and physics at many different universities while he was in Germany.  <br>
									Klaus also joined the German Communistic Party in 1930 before he saw the dangers of the Nazi Party rising to power.  Fearing <br>
									Prosecution by the Nazi Party, he fled to England where he continued his studies.  Klaus was even interned as a German for a <br>
									period of time since his citizenship process was brought to a halt with the outbreak of World War Two.  He was released to <br>
									research the atomic bomb at the University of Birmingham.  Later, in 1942 Klaus gained his British citizenship.  Around this time <br>
									he began passing scientific research that was supposed to be secret to the Soviet Union.  In 1943 he was sent to the United States <br>
									to work within the Manhattan Project unknowingly of his spy status.  Klaus Fuchs contributed to many theoretical advancements while he <br>
									was part of the Manhattan Project, however, he was eventually convicted after the war when he returned to England.  The British caught <br>
									on to his treasonous acts and prosecuted him in 1950 with 14 years of prison.  After which he would pass away after making home in <br>
									East Germany.

								<p>
									Glenn Seaborg contributed to the discovery and development of plutonium for nuclear technology.  Along with Edwin McMillan, he discovered <br>
									plutonium in 1941 at the University of California, Berkeley.  After the discovery, he took leave to participate in the Manhattan Project where he <br>
									was put in charge of producing plutonium-239 for the soon to be Fat Man bomb.  Following the end of World War Two he joined the Atomic Energy Commision <br>
									where he pushed the use of peaceful nuclear technology rather than using it as a means of war.
