									Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected the 32nd President in 1932, where he would stay <br>
									for almost four terms.  The 22nd ammendment would soon only allow two terms in 1951. <br>
									Franklin D. Roosevelt recieved a letter from Albert Einstein about the dangers of nuclear <br>
									uranium in germany.  This would later prompt President Roosevelt to create The Manhattan <br>
									District with the purpose of creating an atomic weapon before Nazi Germany.  The atomic <br>
									bomb would not be witnessed by him as he passed away in April of 1945. <br> <br>
									"<i>The only thing we have to fear is fear itself</i>" - President Franklin D. Roosevelt

									The passing of President Roosevelt allowed Vice President Harry Truman to become the President <br>
									in 1945.  President Truman participated in the ending of World War Two and would continue to <br>
									serve until 1953.  In mid-july, he was notified of the successful Trinity Test allowing for the <br>
									atomic bomb to be used.  The atomic bombs would be dropped in early August of 1945 under President <br>
									Truman's discretion. <br> <br>

									Colonel Leslie Groves was a Army Corps of Engineers officer.  He was appointed the lead position <br>
									of The Manhattan Project in september of 1942.  One of his first steps was appointing Robert Oppenheimer <br>
									the lead scientist at the Los Alamos laboritory.  Colonel Groves headed the atomic bomb process and saw <br>
									through with its completion and delivery to the Japanese cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  His service <br>
									ended in 1947 when the Atomic Energy Commision was created. <br> <br>
									"<i>People who talk of outlawing the atomic bomb are mistaken - what needs to be outlawed is war</i>" - Colonel Leslie Groves

							<div class="right_block">
								<p>
									Robert Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist who contributed deeply to the evolution of atomic development. <br>
									Colonel Groves wished for another scientist to take the reigns of leadership over the design of the atomic <br>
									bomb, however, that scientist was engulfed in the process of uranium seperation on another part of the <br>
									project.  This allowed the position to be offered to Oppenheimer, who accepted the offer under the terms <br>
									that a laboritory be built in Los Alamos fully devoted to the designing of an atomic bomb.  He completed his <br>
									tasks as he watched the trinity test succesfully detonate the worlds first plutonium powered bomb in july of 1945. <br> <br>
									During the test he spoke the words of Hindu scripture: "<i>I am become death, the shatterer of worlds</i>"
