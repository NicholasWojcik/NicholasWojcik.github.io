						<h3><span class="green">The Catalyst</span></h3>
						In 1939 German physicists set the perfect prelude for the Manhattan Project by theoretically proving that 
						nuclear fission was possible.  This sparked worry in many European scientists as the wakening of World War 
						Two had begun.  Scientists all across Europe left their homelands in fear of prosecution by the German Nazi 
						Party.  Britain, Canada, and the United States were common coutries that many found their new homes in.  Two 
						of the most renowned physicists at the time were Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi, also had to flee.  Enrico was 
						well known for his work in bombarding uranium with nuetrons, but it wasn't fully understood until 1939.  Albert 
						Enstein fearing the possibility of nuclear weaponery ending up in Nazi Germany's near future decided to write 
						to the current standing President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Einstein drafted this letter with
						the help of another physicist named Leo Szilard that recently had to vacate Germany after helping them towards 
						nuclear fission.  The letter expressed the concern that Nazi Germany would figure out a way to create an atomic 
						bomb, and that the United States should begin obtaining uranium and studying nuclear fission. <br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">A Response</span></h3>
						Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Advisory Committee on Uranium in response to the letter.  This committee was 
						responsible for the research of uranium and reported to the President himself.  Experiments and research began 
						to take place at universities all across the United States.  The committee continued to research and share information
						with British scientists.  However, its purpose was just to research uranium and fission with no clear plan to create 
						an atomic bomb. <br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Needed Growth</span></h3>
						After some time, it was agreed that a larger group needed to be created to manage the entirety of research and development 
						for defensive purposes.  Thus the National Defense Research Committee(NDRC) was created on June 27th, 1940 with the purpose to partake 
						in defensive based research.  The NDRC absorbed the Advisory Committee on Uranium in order to create cohesion.  During this time 
						it became aware that the British had progressed further in their research than the United States.  The United States was not the only 
						country to begin the race for nuclear weaponery.  Britain had taken on a project of its own named Tube Alloys and Canada took interest 
						in contributing scientists and engineers.  Efforts were made between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill to 
						share information in order to advance against the Axis. <br><br>
						
						With the increasing need to beat Nazi Germany to the atomic bomb, another entity was created.  On June 28th, 1941 Franklin 
						D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807 which created the Office of Scientific Research and Development. <br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Pearl Habor</span></h3>
						Research and development of the atomic bomb would be accelerated after the bombing of Pearl Habor on December 7, 1941.  
						This act of aggression from the Japanese Empire prompted the United States to enter the war in both the European and Pacific 
						theatres.  The Adisory Committee on Uranium met shortly after the reality that the United States had entered an inescapable war.  They 
						discussed methods of isotope seperation to produce uranium-235.  This task was difficult as uraninite consisted of less than 
						1% uranium-235, the other being uranium-238 which made up more than 99%. <br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Military Involvement</span></h3>
						The United States entering war increased drastically the funding that went into all parts of the atomic bomb project.  It also invited 
						the United States Army to help with the research and development as a partnered entity increasing the funding even further.  The military 
						side of the project would be held in Manhattan, New York.  It was common practice for military based projects such as this one, to be named 
						after the city that the engineers work in.  Thus, the Manhattan Engineering District was created.  Eventually it was decided the military 
						should assume all control over the project and it gained the recognizable name The Manhattan Project.  Colonel Leslie Groves, an officer 
						within the Army Corps of Engineers, would be promoted to the rank of Brigadier General to head the Manhattan Project on september 23rd, 1941. <br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Solving Isoptope Seperation</span></h3>
						Now that management and resources were now in place, it was time to focus on the development of the atomic bomb.  Isotope seperation 
						posed a large problem for the physicists and engineers.  Uranium-235 was desired for the fuel capable of substaining a chain reaction.  
						Electromagnetic seperation was tried first but became very expensive as well as inefficient.  Gaseous diffusion was the next method that 
						involved having uranium-235 pass through a porous film while uranium-238 bounced off it.  This method was cheap and highly inefficient.  
						However, the final choice was thermal diffusion.  Thermal diffusion became the main method of producing uranium-235 and the other methods 
						were used as supplements.  Seperating the isotopes took place at many facilities accross the United States and Canada, with the main site 
						being Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  The facility at Oak Ridge was named S-50 Thermal Facility and made enough uranium for a bomb in june of 1945.  
						The uranium would make its way to the K-25 Gaseous Facility also located in Oak Ridge.  There it would be enriched to 23% and again to 89% which 
						scientists aggreed would be enough for a bomb. <br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Robert Oppenheimer</span></h3>
						Leslie Groves took charge of overseeing the building of facilities and planning the locations of them.  He still needed someone to lead the physicists 
						and scientists with their portion of the work.  While his initial pick didn't work out, he turned to Robert Oppenheimer.  Oppenheimer 
						took the position under the terms that a facility be built in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  Leslie Groves aggreed and the site began construction.  
						In the mean-time, the Manhattan Project surpassed the Tube Alloys project in Britain.  This allowed the United States to take full responsibility 
						for producing the atomic bomb as Winston Churchill began sending his scientists and engineers to the Manhattan Project.<br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Los Alamos</span></h3>
						Los Alamos was choosen as the new headquarters for the project.  It became the site responsible for designing and building the atomic bomb.  
						There were two plans drawn for the atomic bomb.  The first named Little Boy, and the second named Fat Man.  Little Boy used uranium-235 as 
						a fuel source.  A simple ignition mechanism was built called gun-type.  Gun-type used conventional explosives to launch a small portion of critical 
						uranium at a larger chunk of uranium that would become sub-critical, allowing for a mechanism to launch nuetrons into it causing a chain reaction.  
						Fat Man used plutonium.  Plutonium could be created by bombarding uranium-238 with a nuetron turning it into uranium-239.  Uranium-239 would eventually 
						decay into plutonium-239.  This process was expensive because new equipment and a new bomb plan had to be constructed to accommodate the different fuel 
						source.<br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Fat Man</span></h3>
						In order to produce the plutonium-239 needed to fuel Fat Man, a new reactor had to be constructed.  The S-10 Reactor was built in Oak Ridge for this purpose.  
						In 1943, S-10 went critical and started producing the needed plutonium.  Unfortunately there was still a lingering problem.  Fat man could not use the same firing 
						mechanism as Little Boy.  Fat Man required pressure to be forced upon the sub-critical mass equally all around its spherical shape.  After trail and error, an new 
						mechanism was made that used conventional explosives wrapped around the sub-critical mass.  Oppenheimer, the physicists, and engineers wanted to see if the plutonium 
						firing mechanism would work.  A test was set into motion.<br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">The Trinity Test</span></h3>
						Alamogordo Army Airfield was choosen for the detonation site and was planned by Kenneth Bainbridge.  The plutonium bomb used for this test was given the nickname 
						The Gadget.  The Gadget was lifted 100 feet and suspended from a tower to produce minimum fallout.  On july 16th, 1945 The Gadget was detonated.  Producing the equivalent 
						to 18,000 tons of TNT, it was felt state wide.  The unaware citizens were informed that a munitions depot had caught fire and exploded.  President Truman had taken over the Oval 
						Office after Franklin D. Roosevelt passed away in April 1945.  Word made it to President Truman that the test was successful and shortly after he used them to put pressure 
						on the Japanese Empire.<br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Hiroshima</span></h3>
						After Japan declined the United States request for unconditional surrender, Truman approved the dropping of the uranium fueled Little Boy atomic bomb.  Little Boy traveled to Hiroshima 
						on august 6th, 1945 via a Boeing B-29 Superfortress named Enola Gay.  Colonel Paul W. Tibbets Jr. piloted the Enola Gay as it released its payload over Hiroshima, instantly killing between 
						60,000 and 80,000 people upon detonation.<br><br><br>
						
						<h3><span class="green">Nagasaki</span></h3>
						Even after the decimation of Hiroshima, Japan still refused to surrender.  This prompted the second bomb to be dropped.  Fat Man was the plutonium based atomic bomb.  On august 9th, 1945 Fat Man 
						set a destination for Kokura Japan also in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, however, this one named Bockscar.  Kokura was abandoned as a target during the mission due to weather complications.  Instead, 
						Major Charles W. Sweeney piloted the Superfortress to Nagasaki where it released the Fat Man instantly removing nearly 40,000 people from the face of Earth.  The following month Japan formally surrendered.
