					<h1>Impacts of the Manhattan Project<h1>
					<h2><span class="green">World War Two</span></h2>
					<p>
						World War Two consisted of two theatres, the European threatre and the Pacific theatre.  <br>
						The European theatre came to an end on May 8, 1945 when Germany surrendered.  However, <br>
						the Pacific theatre raged on.  Casualties continued to rise as the United States continued <br>
						to bomb the Japanese homeland.  Eager to bring an end to the war, plans were drawn for Operation <br>
						Downfall.  Operation Downfall consisted of a full invasion of Japan with an estimated 280,000 <br>
						casualties.  The allies seeked surrender from the Japanese Empire, to which they declined.  <br>
						Ultimately the United States would decide to use the atomic bomb to convince Japan to surrender. <br>
						Hiroshima witnessed the first of two atomic bombs on August 6, 1945.  The nuclear weapon desimated <br>
						15% of Hiroshima's population instantly totaling somewhere between 60,000 and 80,000 people.  <br>
						Again, the United States asked for unconditional surrender from Japan to which they recieved no reply. <br>
						A second bombing was put into motion.  Fat Man detonated over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 wiping the <br>
						existence of nearly 40,000 people instantly.  These bombings along with the Soviet Union declaring <br>
						war with the Japanese Empire prompted them to surrender on September 2, 1945.  In the months to come <br>
						many thousands more would perish due to the atomic bombs lasting effects.

						The Manhattan Project provided a strong catalyst for future development of harnessing nuclear power.  <br>
						Many of the scientists that contributed to the building of the atomic bomb opted out of continuing <br>
						research on atomic weapons as they believed it was being used wrongfully.  However, the Manhattan <br>
						Project had created a wealth of new information and a desire for countries to further see nuclear <br>
						capabilities.  Eventually the hydrogen bomb would be crafted thats devistation far surpassed that of <br>
						the atomic bombs used in World War Two.  The increase in this technology brought forth the Cold War <br>
						between the United States and Russia.  Nuclear research had also expedited the development of nuclear <br>
						technology in other fields.
